No complex APIs. No boilerplate.
Just plug it in and sail your messages effortlessly. ⛵

## How ShiPy feels: 

1. Install ShiPy.
   `pip install ShiPy`

2. If you are a first time user, register yourself. 
  `register("telegram", token= telegram_token, chat_id= chat_id)`

3. Sail your ship!
   ` yard = Telegram(telegram_token)
yard.sail(chat_id, "Hello from ShiPy! 🚀")`
